Coffee
======
A simple application to track coffee ratings.

Running
-------
Open "activator" (or run "activator ui") to open the interface for compiling and
starting the application server. When you are done, terminate the activator
instance via ctrl-c (does not appear to work in cygwin, but works in Windows
CMD) to perform a graceful shutdown.
